## Configuration

The workflow works out of the box with a default `API_KEY` for the [ipgeolocation API](https://ipgeolocation.io/).

The API has a request limit so, if you stick with using the workflow, I suggest that you make your own to let space for other people and not to be rate limited yourself.

You can set your own `API_KEY` in the workflow configuration.

Making a developer `API_KEY` is free of charge as of today.

Enjoy! ðŸ‘‹
